    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Most Bulgogi recipes call for crushed pear. This is for tenderizing the meat. My boyfriend's Korean mother says Coca-Cola® can also be used for the same purpose. This recipe uses very thin-sliced meat so tenderization isn't necessary. Sugar is used instead</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ yellow onion, thinly sliced </li>
        <li>2 green onions, chopped, dark green parts separated from white and light green parts </li>
        <li>⅓ cup soy sauce </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Combine yellow onion, white and light green parts of green onions, soy sauce, sugar, sesame seeds, garlic, sesame oil, red pepper flakes, ginger, and black pepper in a bowl until marinade is well mixed. Add steak slices to marinade; cover and refrigerate, 1 hour to 1 day.</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet over medium heat. Working in batches, cook and stir steak and marinade together in the hot skillet, adding honey to caramelize the steak, until steak is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Garnish bulgogi with green parts of green onions.</li>
        
    </ul>
